# IntelliJ-Workshop

## What's an IDE?
   - An integrated development environment (IDE) is a piece of software that SHOULD make your life as a programmer easier.
   - IntelliJ is an example of an IDE.
   
   ### Purpose
   1. Help the user write code with the use of several common features
   2. Often, let the user compile and run the code completely within the IDE
   3. Sometimes, provide GUI elements with in attempt to abstract ugly details of coding
   
   ### Common Features
   1. Source code editting
   2. Syntax highlighting
   3. Code completion
   4. Easy refactoring
   5. Code cleanup
   6. Debugging
   7. Version control support (e.g. Git, Mercurial)
   8. Easy project navigation
   
   ### Pros of IDEs
   1. Make coding faster
   2. Clean up our mess
   3. Useful when projects grow big
   
   ### Cons of IDEs
   1. Gotta jump through some hoops during setup
   2. Make us reliant on the features they provide
   3. Often do not support all common programming languages

## Getting started with IntelliJ
   1. Click "Create New Project"
   2. Select Java (on upper left side)
   3. Click "Next"
   4. Next screen will ask you to select a template. Just click "Next"
   5. Name your project and make sure its in the directory you want.
   6. Click Finish
   
   ### Adding a Java class
   1. First, make sure you're in your source (src) folder.
   2. Then File, New
   3. Now click on "Java class"
   4. Name your file and start coding!

   ### Editing Configurations
  1. Click on the drop down arrow in the upper right corner, then "Edit Configurations"
  2. Click on the green plus "+" sign and select application.
  3. Select the java class with a main function. (This should load automatically)
  4. Name this configuration.
  5. Specify any program arguments in the "Program Arguments" field
      - This replaces passing arguments from the command line.
  6. Click "apply"
  7. Now you can run your code by clicking the green arrow on top!

## Version Control
   1. On the new project screen, click "Check out from Version Control".
   2. Select which Version Control you want to use (Gitlab = "Git")
   3. Log in. (should only have to do once).
   4. Clone your repository.

# Debugging
   1. Click the space next to the line numbers.
      - a red dot should appear
      - That's where your code will stop
   2. Click the bug in the top right
      - Now you're debugging!
   ### Some buttons to know
   1. Show execution point scrolls to line the code is at
   2. Step over (F8) goes to the next line in the file
   3. Step into (F7) steps to the next line of execution
   4.
